# Thunder Scheduler: Deferred Tasks Tracking

This document tracks tasks that have been strategically deferred to focus on core functionality first. These tasks should be revisited once the main application features are working.

## Pre-Phase 2 Tasks

### Enhanced Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Add comprehensive network failure testing
- [ ] Implement concurrent operation tests
- [ ] Add boundary condition tests
- [ ] Create large dataset performance tests
- [ ] Add more granular error scenario tests

### Performance Monitoring Enhancements
- [ ] Implement detailed Web Vitals tracking
- [ ] Add sophisticated load time monitoring
- [ ] Implement memory usage tracking
- [ ] Add network performance metrics
- [ ] Create performance regression tests
- [ ] Add long-task monitoring
- [ ] Implement React Query cache analytics

### Caching Strategy Optimization
- [ ] Analyze and optimize cache invalidation patterns
- [ ] Implement prefetching for common user flows
- [ ] Add cache persistence for offline support
- [ ] Optimize stale-while-revalidate patterns
- [ ] Add cache warming strategies

### Error Handling Improvements
- [ ] Enhance error recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Add retry strategies for transient failures
- [ ] Implement more granular error types
- [ ] Add detailed error reporting analytics
- [ ] Create error visualization improvements

## Future Enhancements

### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Implement code splitting strategies
- [ ] Add lazy loading for calendar views
- [ ] Optimize bundle size
- [ ] Implement virtual scrolling for large datasets

### Testing Improvements
- [ ] Add visual regression tests
- [ ] Implement E2E testing suite
- [ ] Add load testing infrastructure
- [ ] Create automated performance benchmarks

### Monitoring and Analytics
- [ ] Add user interaction analytics
- [ ] Implement detailed performance dashboards
- [ ] Create automated performance alerts
- [ ] Add API usage analytics

### Developer Experience
- [ ] Enhance development environment setup
- [ ] Add more comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Create better debugging tools
- [ ] Improve build pipeline

## Task Status in Documentation

The following files have been updated to mark tasks as deferred:

1. docs/progress-tracker.md
   - Added "[DEFERRED]" tag to Pre-Phase 2 tasks
   - Moved deferred tasks to a separate section

2. docs/initial-integration-plan.md
   - Marked advanced performance monitoring as deferred
   - Updated timeline to reflect deferred tasks

3. docs/implementation-plan.md
   - Added note about deferred Pre-Phase 2 tasks
   - Updated phase transitions

## Review Process

These deferred tasks should be reviewed:
1. After completing Phase 2 core functionality
2. When specific performance issues are identified
3. As part of regular technical debt reviews
4. When planning future enhancements

## Priority Guidelines

When revisiting these tasks, consider:
1. User impact
2. Performance bottlenecks
3. Error rates and patterns
4. Development team needs
5. Resource availability

## Implementation Notes

When implementing deferred tasks:
1. Assess current impact on application
2. Evaluate technical debt accumulation
3. Consider user feedback and metrics
4. Prioritize based on actual usage patterns
5. Start with high-impact, low-effort items
