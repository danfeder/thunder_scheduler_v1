# Thunder Scheduler: Jest to Vitest Migration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for migrating the Thunder Scheduler testing infrastructure from Jest to Vitest. The primary motivation for this migration is to improve compatibility with MSW v2, which is a critical part of our testing strategy for API integration.

## Current Testing Setup

The Thunder Scheduler project currently uses Jest as its testing framework:

- **Jest Configuration**: Configured in `frontend/jest.config.ts`
- **Test Setup**: Setup file at `frontend/src/setupTests.ts`
- **MSW Integration**: Mock Service Worker (MSW) for API mocking in tests
- **Testing Library**: React Testing Library for component testing
- **Test Structure**:
  - Unit tests in `__tests__` directories
  - Integration tests in `src/test/integration`
  - Example tests in `src/test/examples`

## Challenges with Current Setup

We've encountered several challenges with the current Jest setup:

1. **MSW v2 Compatibility Issues**:
   - `Cannot find module 'msw/node'` errors
   - Issues with the Streams API (`TransformStream`, `ReadableStream`)
   - Problems with response body handling (`response.body.getReader is not a function`)

2. **Polyfill Requirements**:
   - Need for multiple polyfills in the Jest environment
   - Complex setup to make modern web APIs work in JSDOM

3. **ESM Compatibility**:
   - Jest's limited ESM support causes issues with modern packages

## Motivation for Migration

1. **MSW v2 Compatibility**: MSW v2 has better compatibility with Vitest due to its native ESM support and modern JavaScript features. The MSW documentation specifically recommends Vitest for better compatibility.

2. **Performance**: Vitest offers better performance with faster test execution times.

3. **Developer Experience**: Vitest provides a more modern developer experience with features like:
   - Native ESM support
   - Better TypeScript integration
   - Improved watch mode
   - Consistent configuration with Vite
   - Fewer polyfills required

## Migration Steps

### 1. Install Vitest and Related Dependencies

```bash
npm install -D vitest @vitest/ui jsdom @testing-library/jest-dom @vitest/coverage-v8
```

### 2. Create Vitest Configuration

Create a `vitest.config.ts` file in the project root:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';
import { resolve } from 'path';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  test: {
    globals: true,
    environment: 'jsdom',
    setupFiles: ['./src/setupTests.ts'],
    coverage: {
      provider: 'v8',
      reporter: ['text', 'json', 'html'],
    },
    include: [
      '**/__tests__/**/*.test.tsx',
      '**/test/integration/**/*.test.tsx',
      '**/test/examples/**/*.test.tsx'
    ],
  },
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      '@': resolve(__dirname, './src'),
    },
  },
});
```

### 3. Update Package.json Scripts

Update the test scripts in `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "vitest run",
  "test:watch": "vitest",
  "test:ui": "vitest --ui",
  "test:coverage": "vitest run --coverage"
}
```

### 4. Update Setup Files

Modify `src/setupTests.ts` to work with Vitest:

```typescript
import '@testing-library/jest-dom';
import { afterAll, afterEach, beforeAll, vi } from 'vitest';
import { fetch, Headers, Request, Response } from 'cross-fetch';

// Add fetch polyfill for Node.js environment
global.fetch = fetch;
global.Headers = Headers;
global.Request = Request;
global.Response = Response;

// Import MSW server setup
import './test/server';

// Setup mock for ResizeObserver which is not available in JSDOM
global.ResizeObserver = class ResizeObserver {
  constructor(_callback: Function) {}
  observe() {}
  unobserve() {}
  disconnect() {}
};
```

### 5. Update MSW Server Configuration

Update `src/test/server.ts` to work with Vitest:

```typescript
import { http } from 'msw';
import { setupServer } from 'msw/node';
import { scheduleHandlers } from './handlers/schedule';
import { afterAll, afterEach, beforeAll } from 'vitest';

// Create the test server with all handlers
export const server = setupServer(...scheduleHandlers);

// Add request listener to confirm interception
server.events.on('request:start', ({ request }) => {
  console.log('MSW intercepted:', request.method, request.url);
});

// Add response listener to see what's being returned
server.events.on('response:mocked', ({ response }) => {
  console.log('MSW mocked response:', response.status);
});

// Add unhandled request listener
server.events.on('request:unhandled', ({ request }) => {
  console.error('MSW unhandled request:', request.method, request.url);
});

// Start server before all tests
beforeAll(() => {
  server.listen({ onUnhandledRequest: 'error' });
  console.log('MSW server started');
});

// Reset handlers after each test (important for test isolation)
afterEach(() => {
  server.resetHandlers();
  console.log('MSW handlers reset');
});

// Close server after all tests
afterAll(() => {
  server.close();
  console.log('MSW server closed');
});
```

### 6. Update Test Files

Most test files should work without changes, but some Jest-specific APIs might need updates:

1. Replace `jest.fn()` with `vi.fn()`
2. Replace `jest.mock()` with `vi.mock()`
3. Replace `jest.spyOn()` with `vi.spyOn()`
4. Replace `jest.useFakeTimers()` with `vi.useFakeTimers()`
5. Replace `jest.useRealTimers()` with `vi.useRealTimers()`

Example:

```typescript
// Before
jest.mock('../../services/scheduleService', () => ({
  getClass: jest.fn()
}));

// After
vi.mock('../../services/scheduleService', () => ({
  getClass: vi.fn()
}));
```

### 7. Update Test Utilities

Update any test utilities that use Jest-specific APIs:

```typescript
// Before
import { render } from '@testing-library/react';

// After
import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
// No change needed for most testing-library functions
```

### 8. Run Tests and Fix Issues

Run the tests with Vitest and fix any issues that arise:

```bash
npm test
```

## Compatibility Considerations

### 1. Global Jest Object

Vitest provides a compatible API for most Jest features, but some differences exist:

- `jest.setTimeout()` becomes `vi.setConfig({ testTimeout: X })`
- `jest.retryTimes()` becomes `vi.retry(X)`

### 2. Configuration Differences

- Jest uses `jest.config.js` or `jest.config.ts`
- Vitest uses `vitest.config.ts` or `vite.config.ts`

### 3. Snapshot Testing

Snapshot testing works similarly in Vitest, but the snapshot format might be slightly different.

## Testing Strategy Updates

### 1. MSW Integration

With Vitest, MSW v2 should work more reliably due to better ESM support. This will allow us to:

- Properly mock API responses
- Test error scenarios
- Verify component behavior with different API responses

### 2. Performance Improvements

Vitest's faster test execution will improve the development workflow:

- Faster feedback loop
- More efficient CI/CD pipeline
- Better developer experience

## Rollback Plan

If the migration encounters significant issues, we can roll back to Jest:

1. Revert package.json changes
2. Revert configuration files
3. Revert any code changes made to accommodate Vitest

## Timeline

1. **Day 1**: Setup and Configuration
   - Install Vitest and dependencies
   - Create configuration files
   - Update package.json scripts

2. **Day 2**: Update Test Files
   - Update setup files
   - Update MSW configuration
   - Fix any Jest-specific API usage

3. **Day 3**: Testing and Validation
   - Run all tests
   - Fix any remaining issues
   - Validate MSW integration

## Success Criteria

The migration will be considered successful when:

1. All tests pass with Vitest
2. MSW v2 integration works properly
3. Test coverage remains the same or improves
4. Test execution time is the same or faster

## Conclusion

Migrating from Jest to Vitest will significantly improve our testing infrastructure, particularly for API integration tests using MSW v2. The migration addresses several key challenges we've encountered:

1. **Resolves MSW v2 Compatibility Issues**: Vitest's modern architecture and better ESM support will eliminate the compatibility issues we've faced with MSW v2, allowing us to properly test our API integrations.

2. **Reduces Configuration Complexity**: Vitest requires fewer polyfills and custom configurations, resulting in a cleaner testing setup that's easier to maintain.

3. **Improves Developer Experience**: Faster test execution, better watch mode, and improved TypeScript integration will enhance the development workflow.

4. **Future-Proofs Our Testing Infrastructure**: Vitest is designed for modern JavaScript applications and will better support our needs as we continue to evolve the Thunder Scheduler application.

The migration should be relatively straightforward since Vitest provides a compatible API for most Jest features. By following this migration plan, we can ensure a smooth transition with minimal disruption to our development process.
