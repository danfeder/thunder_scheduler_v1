# Thunder Scheduler: Schedule Visualization Phase

## Project Context
I'm working on the Thunder Scheduler project, a cooking class scheduler application that helps organize classes for 33 elementary school classes around existing schedule constraints. The project uses a constraint satisfaction approach with Google OR-Tools.

## Current Progress
We've completed several phases of the project:
- Project setup with Node.js/Express backend and React frontend
- PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM
- Basic project structure and API endpoints
- Docker configuration for local development
- OR-Tools integration with Python solver
- Basic Constraint Model with comprehensive testing
- CSV Import/Export functionality with validation
- Basic UI implementation with core components, state management, and API integration

All code is in the GitHub repository: https://github.com/danfeder/thunder_scheduler_v1
We're currently on the `feature/schedule-visualization` branch.

## Next Task: Schedule Visualization
According to our progress tracker (docs/progress-tracker.md), we've completed Phase 1, Step 6: Basic UI Implementation and are now moving to Phase 1, Step 7: Schedule Visualization. This involves:
- Basic calendar view
- Schedule display
- Conflict highlighting

## Key Documentation
Please refer to these files for detailed context:
- docs/project-brief.md: Contains the full project requirements
- docs/implementation-plan.md: Details the technical approach and architecture
- docs/progress-tracker.md: Shows what's been completed and what's next
- docs/basic-ui-implementation-plan.md: Details the UI components we've already implemented
- frontend/src/App.tsx: Main React application entry point
- frontend/src/components/schedule/ScheduleDisplay.tsx: Current basic schedule display
- frontend/src/context/ScheduleContext.tsx: Global state management for schedules
- frontend/src/services/scheduleService.ts: Service for schedule-related API operations

## Technical Requirements
The Schedule Visualization implementation needs to handle:
1. Calendar View:
   - Weekly view of the schedule
   - Clear representation of time slots
   - Visual distinction between days and periods
   - Support for multi-week rotations

2. Schedule Display:
   - Display classes in appropriate time slots
   - Color-coding for different grade levels
   - Clear labeling of class names
   - Indication of empty slots

3. Conflict Highlighting:
   - Visual indicators for scheduling conflicts
   - Highlighting of constraint violations
   - Tooltips or messages explaining conflicts
   - Different visual treatments for different types of conflicts

## Current Implementation
We've successfully implemented:
- Basic UI components (Button, Card, LoadingSpinner)
- Schedule and class data models with TypeScript
- State management with React Context
- API integration for schedule and class data
- Simple tabular schedule display

We need to enhance the visualization to provide a more intuitive and informative calendar view.

## Specific Tasks
1. Enhance the ScheduleDisplay component:
   - Implement a more calendar-like grid layout
   - Add proper day and period headers
   - Improve the visual representation of classes
   - Add support for viewing different weeks in the rotation

2. Implement conflict visualization:
   - Create visual indicators for different types of conflicts
   - Add tooltips or popups for conflict details
   - Implement color-coding for conflict severity

3. Add interactive elements:
   - Week selection for multi-week rotations
   - Filtering options (by grade, by conflict status, etc.)
   - Zoom or detail level controls

## Implementation Approach
- Continue using React with TypeScript for type safety
- Leverage Tailwind CSS for styling
- Consider using a lightweight calendar library if needed
- Implement responsive design for different screen sizes
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Include unit tests for visualization components

Please help me implement the Schedule Visualization functionality for the Thunder Scheduler project, focusing on creating an intuitive, informative calendar view that clearly shows the schedule and any conflicts.
