# Thunder Scheduler: Initial Integration Phase

## Project Context
I'm working on the Thunder Scheduler project, a cooking class scheduler application that helps organize classes for 33 elementary school classes around existing schedule constraints. The project uses a constraint satisfaction approach with Google OR-Tools.

## Current Progress
We've completed several phases of the project:
- Project setup with Node.js/Express backend and React frontend
- PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM
- Basic project structure and API endpoints
- Docker configuration for local development
- OR-Tools integration with Python solver
- Basic Constraint Model with comprehensive testing
- CSV Import/Export functionality with validation
- Basic UI implementation with core components, state management, and API integration
- Schedule Visualization with specialized components for different use cases

All code is in the GitHub repository: https://github.com/danfeder/thunder_scheduler_v1
We're currently on the `feature/schedule-visualization` branch.

## Next Task: Initial Integration
According to our progress tracker (docs/progress-tracker.md), we've completed Phase 1, Step 7: Schedule Visualization and are now moving to Phase 1, Step 8: Initial Integration. This involves:
- API endpoints
- Error handling
- Basic testing

## Key Documentation
Please refer to these files for detailed context:
- docs/project-brief.md: Contains the full project requirements
- docs/implementation-plan.md: Details the technical approach and architecture
- docs/progress-tracker.md: Shows what's been completed and what's next
- docs/schedule-visualization-plan-revised.md: Details the visualization components we've implemented
- frontend/src/App.tsx: Main React application entry point
- frontend/src/components/schedule/: Directory containing all schedule visualization components
- frontend/src/context/ScheduleContext.tsx: Global state management for schedules
- frontend/src/services/scheduleService.ts: Service for schedule-related API operations

## Technical Requirements
The Initial Integration implementation needs to handle:

1. API Endpoints:
   - Connect frontend components to backend services
   - Implement proper data fetching and submission
   - Handle asynchronous operations gracefully
   - Ensure type safety between frontend and backend

2. Error Handling:
   - Implement comprehensive error handling for API calls
   - Display user-friendly error messages
   - Add error boundaries for component failures
   - Implement retry mechanisms where appropriate

3. Basic Testing:
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - End-to-end testing of key workflows
   - Test error handling and edge cases
   - Ensure proper data validation

## Current Implementation
We've successfully implemented:
- Three distinct schedule visualization components:
  - ClassConflictManager: Simple grid for toggling class conflicts
  - InstructorAvailability: Date-based calendar for teacher scheduling
  - GeneratedSchedule: Complex calendar for displaying the final schedule
- Comprehensive test suite for all visualization components
- Logical input-to-output flow layout
- Grade-based filtering and week rotation support
- Conflict highlighting and visualization

## Specific Tasks
1. Complete API Integration:
   - Connect ClassConflictManager to backend conflict management endpoints
   - Integrate InstructorAvailability with teacher availability API
   - Link GeneratedSchedule with schedule generation and retrieval endpoints
   - Implement proper loading states and error handling

2. Enhance Error Handling:
   - Create reusable error handling utilities
   - Implement error boundaries around key components
   - Add user-friendly error messages and recovery options
   - Log errors for debugging purposes

3. Implement Integration Tests:
   - Test API integration with frontend components
   - Verify data flow between components
   - Test error scenarios and recovery
   - Ensure proper state management across the application

## Implementation Approach
- Continue using React with TypeScript for type safety
- Implement proper API service layer
- Use React Query or similar for data fetching and caching
- Add comprehensive error handling utilities
- Implement integration tests with React Testing Library and MSW
- Ensure responsive design and accessibility

Please help me implement the Initial Integration functionality for the Thunder Scheduler project, focusing on connecting the visualization components to the backend services and ensuring robust error handling.
