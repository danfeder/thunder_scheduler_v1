# Thunder Scheduler: Pre-Phase 2 Preparation

## Project Context
I'm working on the Thunder Scheduler project, a cooking class scheduler application that helps organize classes for 33 elementary school classes around existing schedule constraints. The project uses a constraint satisfaction approach with Google OR-Tools.

## Current Progress
We've completed Phase 1 of the project:
- Project setup with Node.js/Express backend and React frontend
- PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM
- Basic project structure and API endpoints
- Docker configuration for local development
- OR-Tools integration with Python solver
- Basic Constraint Model with comprehensive testing
- CSV Import/Export functionality with validation
- Basic UI implementation with core components, state management, and API integration
- Schedule Visualization with specialized components for different use cases
- Error handling infrastructure and React Query integration
- MSW setup for API mocking in tests
- Container components with real API implementations for all visualization components
- Integration tests with mock services for all components
- Migration from Jest to Vitest for better MSW v2 compatibility
- Integration tests updated to work with MSW v2
- Basic real API testing implementation
- Initial performance monitoring utilities
- Health endpoint for backend status monitoring

All code is in the GitHub repository: https://github.com/danfeder/thunder_scheduler_v1
We're currently on the `feature/initial-integration` branch.

## Next Task: Complete Pre-Phase 2 Preparation
According to our updated implementation plan (docs/implementation-plan.md), we've completed Phase 1, including the initial integration step. Before moving to Phase 2, we need to complete the Pre-Phase 2 Preparation tasks:
- Add more comprehensive tests for edge cases like network failures
- Test with larger datasets to ensure performance
- Add more tests for error scenarios with real APIs
- Implement more detailed performance metrics
- Add more sophisticated load time monitoring
- Further optimize caching strategies
