# Thunder Scheduler: Basic UI Implementation Phase

## Project Context
I'm working on the Thunder Scheduler project, a cooking class scheduler application that helps organize classes for 33 elementary school classes around existing schedule constraints. The project uses a constraint satisfaction approach with Google OR-Tools.

## Current Progress
We've completed several phases of the project:
- Project setup with Node.js/Express backend and React frontend
- PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM
- Basic project structure and API endpoints
- Docker configuration for local development
- OR-Tools integration with Python solver
- Basic Constraint Model with comprehensive testing
- CSV Import/Export functionality with validation

All code is in the GitHub repository: https://github.com/danfeder/thunder_scheduler_v1
We're currently on the `feature/basic-ui` branch.

## Next Task: Basic UI Implementation
According to our progress tracker (docs/progress-tracker.md), we've completed Phase 1, Step 5: CSV Import/Export and are now moving to Phase 1, Step 6: Basic UI Implementation. This involves:
- Core components development
- State management implementation
- API integration

## Key Documentation
Please refer to these files for detailed context:
- docs/project-brief.md: Contains the full project requirements
- docs/implementation-plan.md: Details the technical approach and architecture
- docs/progress-tracker.md: Shows what's been completed and what's next
- frontend/src/App.tsx: Main React application entry point
- backend/src/services/csv.service.ts: CSV handling service
- backend/src/services/solver.service.ts: Node.js service that interfaces with the Python solver
- backend/src/services/schedule.service.ts: Service for schedule generation and management

## Technical Requirements
The Basic UI implementation needs to handle:
1. Core React components for:
   - Schedule display
   - Class list management
   - CSV import/export interface
2. State management for:
   - Schedule data
   - Class conflicts
   - Application status
3. API integration for:
   - Schedule generation
   - CSV operations
   - Data validation

## Current Implementation
We've successfully implemented the backend services:
- Constraint solver with OR-Tools
- Schedule generation and validation
- CSV import/export with error handling
- Comprehensive testing suite

We need to build the frontend interface to interact with these services.

## Specific Tasks
1. Implement core React components:
   - Create basic layout structure
   - Implement schedule display component
   - Build class management interface
   - Design CSV import/export forms

2. Set up state management:
   - Define state structure
   - Implement state updates
   - Handle loading and error states

3. Integrate with backend API:
   - Create API service layer
   - Implement data fetching
   - Handle error responses
   - Add loading indicators

## Implementation Approach
- Use React with TypeScript for type safety
- Implement responsive design with CSS modules
- Create reusable component library
- Add error boundaries for robust error handling
- Include unit tests for components

Please help me implement the Basic UI functionality for the Thunder Scheduler project, focusing on creating a clean, intuitive user interface that effectively leverages our backend services.
