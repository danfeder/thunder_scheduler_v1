- [ ] Final testing and refinement

## Current Status
- ✅ Completed Phase 1 with all core functionality:
  - Error handling infrastructure
  - React Query integration
  - Real API implementations
  - Integration tests with MSW v2
  - Performance monitoring basics
- Successfully implemented three core components:
  - ClassConflictManager: Grid for class conflicts
  - InstructorAvailability: Teacher scheduling calendar
  - GeneratedSchedule: Final schedule display
- Phase 2 progress:
  - ✅ Completed drag-and-drop functionality for GeneratedSchedule
  - ✅ Implemented real-time constraint validation
  - ✅ Added visual feedback for drag operations
  - Next: Improve InstructorAvailability with multi-period selection

## Notes
- Pre-Phase 2 tasks (comprehensive tests, advanced monitoring, etc.) have been moved to docs/deferred-tasks.md
- Phase 2 will enhance existing components rather than introducing new calendar libraries
- Focus on improving user experience with our current grid-based approach
- Building on established component patterns
- Using @hello-pangea/dnd for drag-drop functionality
- Documentation updated to reflect revised approach:
  - docs/phase-2-implementation-plan.md: New implementation strategy
  - docs/deferred-tasks.md: Tasks for future consideration
  - docs/progress-tracker.md: Updated progress tracking
