## Current Status
- Completed Phase 1 steps 1-7
- Partially completed Phase 1, Step 8 (Initial Integration):
  - Implemented error handling infrastructure
  - Set up React Query for data fetching
  - Created example components and tests
  - Remaining: Component-specific API integration
- Implemented Schedule Visualization with three distinct components:
  - ClassConflictManager: Simple grid for toggling class conflicts
  - InstructorAvailability: Date-based calendar for teacher scheduling
  - GeneratedSchedule: Complex calendar for displaying the final schedule
- Created specialized component architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Implemented comprehensive test suite for all visualization components
- Added date-based navigation and week rotation support
- Implemented conflict highlighting and grade-based filtering
- Organized components in a logical input-to-output flow layout

## Notes
