## Current Status
- Completed Phase 1 steps 1-7
- Significantly advanced Phase 1, Step 8 (Initial Integration):
  - Implemented error handling infrastructure
  - Set up React Query for data fetching
  - Created container components with mock services
  - Implemented loading states and error handling
  - Created integration tests with mock services
  - Set up MSW for API mocking in tests
  - Replaced mock services with real API implementations
  - Updated App.tsx to use container components
  - Remaining: Test with real backend APIs and add tests for edge cases
- Implemented Schedule Visualization with three distinct components:
  - ClassConflictManager: Simple grid for toggling class conflicts
  - InstructorAvailability: Date-based calendar for teacher scheduling
  - GeneratedSchedule: Complex calendar for displaying the final schedule
- Created specialized component architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Implemented comprehensive test suite for all visualization components
- Added date-based navigation and week rotation support
- Implemented conflict highlighting and grade-based filtering
- Organized components in a logical input-to-output flow layout

## Notes
- Frontend work has been simplified to basic React setup
- Tailwind CSS integrated for styling components
- OR-Tools integration and Basic Constraint Model completed
- Comprehensive testing suite implemented with pytest and Vitest
- CSV Import/Export completed with testing
- Following step-by-step approach as per implementation plan
- Detailed UI implementation plan documented in docs/basic-ui-implementation-plan.md
- Schedule visualization implemented according to revised plan in docs/schedule-visualization-plan-revised.md
- Error handling infrastructure and React Query integration completed
- MSW setup for API mocking in tests completed
- Container components now using real API implementations
- Successfully migrated from Jest to Vitest for better MSW v2 compatibility
- Integration tests updated to work with MSW v2
- Next steps:
  1. ✅ Migrate testing framework from Jest to Vitest
  2. ✅ Fix integration tests to work with MSW v2
  3. Test with real backend APIs
  4. Add tests for edge cases and error scenarios
  5. Implement performance monitoring
  6. Prepare for Phase 2: Enhanced UI and Manual Adjustments
- Detailed integration plan and progress tracking in docs/initial-integration-plan.md and docs/component-api-integration-plan.md
- Migration plan from Jest to Vitest documented in docs/jest-to-vitest-migration-plan.md
