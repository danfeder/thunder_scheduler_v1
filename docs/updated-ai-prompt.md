# Cooking Class Scheduler Development Task

I need you to build a Cooking Class Scheduler web application based on the attached project brief. This application will help manage cooking class scheduling for 33 elementary school classes, working around existing schedule constraints.

## Your Task

1. Review the provided project brief thoroughly to understand all requirements.
2. Design and implement the application using a modern web framework.
3. Focus first on the scheduling algorithm using Google OR-Tools as specified in the brief.
4. Follow the phased implementation approach outlined in Section 8 of the brief.
5. Build a clean, intuitive interface appropriate for non-technical users.
6. Follow the testing approach detailed in the "Testing Approach for Cooking Class Scheduler" document using the provided test datasets.

## Key Technical Requirements

- Implement a constraint satisfaction algorithm using Google OR-Tools
- Create a web-based interface that's intuitive for non-technical users
- Enable import/export of schedule data via CSV
- Build a visual calendar interface
- Allow for manual adjustments via drag-and-drop
- Prioritize Phase 1 functionality first
- Pay special attention to the multi-week rotation capabilities

## Development Process

1. Start by setting up the basic project structure and dependencies
2. Implement the core scheduling engine using OR-Tools
3. Create a minimal UI to test the scheduling algorithm
4. Gradually build out the full interface
5. Implement data import/export functionality
6. Add manual adjustment capabilities
7. Follow the phased testing approach detailed in the "Testing Approach for Cooking Class Scheduler" document, starting with small test datasets before moving to the full 33-class dataset

## Technical Questions to Consider

- What framework would be most appropriate for the frontend?
- How will you structure the data model?
- What's the best approach to integrate OR-Tools with the web application?
- How will you visualize scheduling conflicts?
- What's the most efficient way to represent the schedule data?
- How will you handle multi-week rotations in the scheduling algorithm?
- What's the best way to visualize the schedule across multiple weeks?

Please begin by outlining your approach to the project, including your proposed technology stack and implementation plan.
